I am broadly interested in building assistive and inclusive technology! To this end, I am currently developing closed-loop interfaces for EMG-driven hand prostheses by combining algorithms that faithfully decode user intention with intuitive tactile feedback.

I am a PhD candidate in the [lab](https://www.neurorehabsystems.aau.dk) of [Strahinja Dosen](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/113479) at the Health Science and Technology Department in Aalborg University, Denmark. I was previously a research assistant in the lab of [Matthias Bethge](https://www.bethgelab.org), where I worked on neural network models of the proprioceptive system with [Alexander Mathis](https://people.epfl.ch/alexander.mathis).
